### Hi there! I'm Héctor 👋

**Computer Engineering Student | AI & Data Enthusiast | Software Developer**

I am a curious, proactive, and responsible engineer who defines himself as a **creative leader** (although my code is definitely cleaner than my drawings). I thrive in collaborative environments and I am not afraid to step out of my comfort zone to present a project or lead a team.

### Professional Vision & Engineering Approach

I don't just write code; **I build solutions**. My approach to engineering is hybrid, bridging the gap between raw technical implementation and strategic business logic.

**What I bring to the table:**

* 💻 **Software Craftsmanship:** I believe in writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code. My background in **Java (OOP)** and **Software Architecture** allows me to design robust systems, not just scripts.
* 📊 **Data-Driven Intelligence:** I use **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** (R, SQL, Clustering) to uncover patterns and support decision-making. I turn data into actionable insights (like in my Casino User Segmentation project).
* 🤝 **Leadership & Management:** Unlike the typical quiet dev, I am **"echado para adelante"** (bold & proactive). I hold a **Certification in Team Management**, and I excel at public speaking, team coordination, and translating technical jargon into human language.

### Career Objective: The Road to Switzerland 🇨🇭

My professional goal is to establish my career in the **Swiss Tech Industry**. I admire the precision, quality, and innovation of the DACH region.

* **Current Status:** actively improving my Technical Portfolio and Engineering skills.
* **Language:** Commited to learning **German** (Deutsch lernen!) to fully integrate into the culture and professional environment.
* **Availability:** Open to internships and junior roles where I can demonstrate my commitment and rapid learning curve.

### Tech Stack & Tools

* **Core:** Java (Object-Oriented Programming), R (Statistical Analysis), SQL (Relational DBs).
* **Data & AI:** Machine Learning (Clustering, Regression), Data Visualization (ggplot2), Database Design (ERD).
* **Workflow:** Git/GitHub, VS Code, Agile Methodologies.

### The Personal Side: Discipline & Creativity

My personality is a mix of engineering precision and artistic curiosity:

* **The Self-Taught Athlete:** Expert in **Hypertrophy & Strength Training**. I apply the same consistency and data-driven approach to the gym as I do to my algorithms.
* **The Creative Soul:** Passionate about **Streetwear, Interior Design, and Art Books**. I believe software should not only work well but also feel "aesthetic" and structured.
* **The Energy:** I recharge with **Racket Sports**, **Anime**, and **Latin Music**. I am a sea lover and fascinated by marine life 🌊.
